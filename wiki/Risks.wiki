#summary Risks List

As for all our risks:
  
  * Our first risk would be to not complete our project.  This risk involves not only the four of us, but our numerous stakeholders.  This is a concern because none of us have any experience with Ruby on Rails and we have to deal with our busy schedules.  Learning Ruby may prove to too much work in too small of a time.  

  * Another risk we face is the software support for our database on the RPI network.  Previously, a database was in use that is not supported on any of the campus computers and was consequently hosted on an off campus computer.  This risk is the reason why a new data management client is needed, since the person hosting it is graduating.
