#summary Howto Set up your Rails Environment

= Instructions =

  == Setting up Ruby ==

    * Download Ruby from http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/

    * When installing, make sure you add ruby and gems to the Windows Path

    * C:\> gem install rails --include-dependencies

    * C:\> gem install -v=2.3.4 rails

    * C:\> gem install sqlite3-ruby

    * Download the [http://www.sqlite.org/sqlitedll-3_6_22.zip SQLite3 DLL], unzip it, and copy it to your C:\Ruby\bin folder. 

  == Initializing the Project ==
    * C:\> svn checkout https://yesdatabas.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ yesdatabas --username YourUserName

  == Final Thoughts ==
    We have to standardize which versions of software we are using.  Since the hosting we have uses specific versions of ruby and rails, we should standardize around this.
