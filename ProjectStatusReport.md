We have completed the work for the inception, and in doing so have planned the structure and scope of the project we will be developing.

The first issue we encountered was that our schedules were very full leaving almost no time to meet during weekdays.  We had one weekend where a few of our group members were unable to meet.  We solved the issue by meeting at night on Monday and bonding over Pizza.

The other issue we faced was our lack of knowledge in the programming language we have chosen to develop yesdatabas in, Ruby on Rails.  We solved this issue by finding tutorials on Ruby on Rails and some that address tips on specific features we will be creating.
