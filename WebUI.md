This shows mainly the data members required.
In addition to including these data members, we need to include the ability
to export to excel docs with formatting.
It'd be nice to post a link to a google calendar or a separate calendar.
> Currently the way the system works is any new events are posted on the
google calendar.  People can sign up using a script on the R&W webpage.  I'm
not sure how these signups work, but I think they might be through google
docs.  Now, After the event, each attendee must submit an event wrap up
form.  This form is then moved (manually) from google docs, inspected, and
placed in another folder.  It is then my job to check all those events, add
the event into the attendance excel sheet.  I'd like to automate this
system, so when an event wrap up form is submitted, attendance is noted and
the wrap up form is placed  in another folder.
Take a look at the site :  http://redandwhite.alumni.rpi.edu/.  There is a
webmaster who is in charge of this, but take a look at what he does.
> Integrating this website with the database would make things a lot easier.
> I don't mean to entirely integrate, but partially (signup forms, event wrap
ups, attendance).
